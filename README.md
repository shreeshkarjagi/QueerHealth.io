# QueerHealth.io

##Inspiration##
The growing need for accessible and inclusive healthcare for the LGBTQ+ community inspired us to create QueerHealth.

##What it does##
QueerHealth is a comprehensive web page that provides a map of resources for STD/STI testing, sexual assault support, abortion care, contraception options, gender-affirming medical care, and mental health support.

##How we built it##
We built QueerHealth using Google Maps API, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies allowed us to create an interactive map of resources and provide a user-friendly experience for those seeking healthcare.

##Challenges we ran into##
Almost starting over at 10 pm and pivoting to different project idea. Ensuring the accuracy and availability of resources was a challenge, but we were able to overcome it through constant research and collaboration. Debugging a lot of html and css.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of##
We are proud to offer a one-stop-shop for the LGBTQ+ community at UCLA to access the healthcare they need and deserve.

##What we learned##
We learnt a lot about web development, and integrating other APIs like mymaps by Google. Also coding for the first time!

##What's next for QueerHealth##
We plan to expand our platform to reach more people and offer even more resources for the LGBTQ+ community's healthcare needs. As well as have a backend that updates a real-time database where community members can add to the resources.

##Built With##
css, google-maps, html
